# Zendo

Based on the board game of the same name. One attendee becomes the Leader and secretly creates a rule for a list of integers and an example list. For example:

 - All even numbers (2,8,6,122)
 - All sequential numbers (5,6,7,8)
 - All prime numbers (5,2,5,13)

Then the other attendees take turns creating test lists and asking the Leader if they satisfy the secret rule. Attendees discuss after each guess what the rule could be. This repeats until the group is happy, they know the rule. They then ask the Leader if their solution is correct. Succeed or fail, rotate the Leader role and go again.

## Tips

It helps to run this over some chat application to see the guess history. 

Keep a list of players to make guessing and Leader role rotate fairly.
