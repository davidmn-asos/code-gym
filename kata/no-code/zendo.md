Based on the board game of the same name. One player becomes the Rule Setter and secretly creates a rule for a list of integers and an example list. For example:

 - All even numbers (2,8,6,122)
 - All sequential numbers (5,6,7,8)
 - All prime numbers (5,2,5,13)

Then the other players take turns creating test lists and asking the Rule Setter if they satisfy the secret rule. Players discuss after each guess what the rule could be. This repeats until the group is happy, they know the rule. They then ask the Rule Setter if their solution is correct. Succeed or fail, rotate the Rule Setter role and go again.

## Example play

- Player 1 becomes the Rule Setter
- The Rule Setter secretly creates a rule
- The Rule Setter says 2,6,8,10
- Player 2 asks if 12,14,2,8 satisfies the rule
- The Rule Setter says it does
- Player 2 asks if 2,6,8,1 satisfies the rule
- The Rule Setter says it does not
- The group agree to ask the Rule Setter if the rule is "All even numbers"
- The Rule Setter confirms it is the rule
- Player 2 becomes the Rule Setter 
- The Rule Setter secretly creates a rule
- etc

## Tips

It helps to run this over some chat application to see the guess history. When a new rule is suggested, somehow mark this in chat so you can ignore previous guesses.

Keep a list of players to make guessing and Leader role rotate fairly.
